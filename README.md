# Android-Network-Switch

村井研究会のTERMでした。

This app is a demonstration to show that it possible to switch networks on/off manually. 

My plan for the next step was to create a whitelist of hosts and trigger the network off for hosts not whitelisted.

Unfortunately, the project was put on hold indefinitely due to legality reasons as cited by my advisors in the Murai and Takeda lab, hence the repository has been set to public in hopes that this research may aid someone in the future.
